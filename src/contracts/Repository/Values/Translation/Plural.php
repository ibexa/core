/**
 * Class for translatable messages, which may contain plural forms.
 *
 * The message might include replacements, in the form %[A-Za-z]%. Those are
 * replaced by the values provided. A raw % can be escaped like %%.
 *
 * You need to provide a singular and plural variant for the string. The
 * strings provided should be English and will be translated depending on the
 * environment language.
 *
 * This interface follows the interfaces of XLIFF, gettext, Symfony Translations and Zend_Translate.
 * For singular forms you just provide a plain string (with optional placeholders without effects on the plural forms).
 * For potential plural forms you always provide a singular variant and an English simple plural variant.
 * An instance of this class can be cast to a string. In such case whether to use singular or plural form is determined
 * based on the value of first element of $values array (it needs to be 1 for singular, anything else for plural).
 * If plurality cannot be inferred from $values, a plural form is assumed as default. To force singular form,
 * use {@see \Ibexa\Contracts\Core\Repository\Values\Translation\Message} instead.
 *
 * No implementation supports multiple different plural forms in one single message.
 *
 * The singular / plural string could, for Symfony, for example be converted
 * to "$singular|$plural", and you would call gettext like: ngettext(
 * $singular, $plural, $count ).
